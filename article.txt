# Vowessly: Cataloging research using semi-structed data

## Introduction: What is Vowessly?
In the autumn of 2010, Laura Wood was beginning research for her PhD. The topic of her research was vowesses: laywomen who had taken a vow of chastity, in the province of Canterbury c. 1450 to 1540. She started by using a spreadsheet to organise her research, which did enable her to make comparisons between vowesses but rapidly became unwieldy because of the variety and quantity of the information involved. The structure of the data did not lend itself well to the column based nature of a spreadsheet. Laura found herself with pages of notes which did not fit precisely into any column. Jon Wood then suggested that a less structured format such as a wiki may be more appropriate. However, we did want to find a way to retain some element of structure. Finding no existing software which fit well, Jon started to build a new piece of software named Vowessly.

Vowessly combines the free text format of a wiki with the more structured properties of a database. Each page consists of a large page body with the option to add facts. These facts can be linked to other pages containing more detail. For example, a page about a vowess may contain some notes in the body, and several facts about that vowess, such as to whom they were married or their parish church. Each fact has the potential to link to another page with more detail. In this way, connections between vowesses can be found. We believe that this approach to cataloguing information could be widely applicable to a range of research topics.

## The development of Vowessly

Once the decision had been made that we were going to build a new piece of software for Laura's research, we began by listing what the most important features were and then sketching out how the application would be used. [ TODO: Flesh this out ]

In November 2010, Jon started to use [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrail.s.org) and [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) to build the application, which allowed him to create a basic prototype quickly. The first version of Vowessly allowed for pages to be created, and facts to be attached to those pages. Each page would have a title, a space for content (usually Laura's notes), and what we called a "content type". The content type allowed similar pages to be grouped together, such as "Vowesses", "Parish Churches", or "Wills". The facts attached to a page were used to include more structured data, such as "Birth location" with fields for details on that piece of information, including its source and the date if appropriate. Facts also had a content type, which allowed them to link to a page on that subject if one existed.

This early prototype took only a few days to complete, and allowed us to see how the idea worked in practice, with the ability to create pages and use facts to link between them. It was deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com)'s free hosting service, which is adequate for most small applications. At this point Laura started to use Vowessly to record her research.

Having used the application for three months, Laura was finding the data entry tiresome and error prone. Since much of the data entry was repetitive information, we added autocompletion of content types and page names. When she started to type a page name a list of possible pages would be preseneted, with the option to select one. We also added the ability to search facts attached to pages, for example finding all pages linked to the vowess Margaret Croke.

## Stuff to be put somewhere

[TODO: Put this somewhere appropriate] Although this was not visible to users any changes were saved allowing accidental changes to be recovered from.
